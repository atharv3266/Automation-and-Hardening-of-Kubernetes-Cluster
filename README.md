## Project Overview

This project focuses on the automation and security hardening of a Kubernetes cluster. The objective is to automate the deployment, configuration, and hardening processes to ensure that the Kubernetes environment is secure, resilient, and ready for production use.

## Features

- **Automated Kubernetes Cluster Setup**: Scripts to automate the setup of a Kubernetes cluster.
- **Security Hardening**: Implementation of best practices for securing the Kubernetes environment, including network policies, RBAC, pod security policies, and more.
- **Modular and Scalable**: Easily adaptable to different environments and scales for clusters of various sizes.
- **Compliance with Security Standards**: Aligns with industry standards and guidelines like CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- A system running Linux (CentOS, Ubuntu, Debian, or Kali).
- Root or sudo access to your system.
- Basic knowledge of Kubernetes, Docker, and Linux commands.
- The following software installed:
  - Docker
  - Kubernetes (`kubeadm`, `kubectl`, `kubelet`)
  - `git`
  - `curl`
  - `sed`, `grep`, and other common Unix utilities

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kubernetes-cluster-hardening.git
   cd kubernetes-cluster-hardening
   ```

2. **Run the Setup Script**:
   Execute the primary setup script to deploy the Kubernetes cluster:
   ```bash
   bash setup.sh
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**:
   Edit any configuration files as necessary to match your environment. Key files to consider:
   - `config/kubernetes.conf`
   - `config/firewall.conf`
   - `config/containerd-config.toml`

4. **Start the Hardening Process**:
   Run the hardening script after the cluster is set up:
   ```bash
   bash hardening.sh
   ```

## Usage

Once the setup and hardening scripts have been executed, you can manage your Kubernetes cluster as usual with `kubectl` commands. The cluster should now be secured according to the best practices outlined in the hardening script.

### Example Commands:

- **Check Cluster Nodes**:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  ```

- **Deploy an Application**:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
  ```

## Cluster Hardening

The hardening script implements several security measures, including but not limited to:

- **Network Policies**: Restricting network access between pods.
- **Pod Security Policies**: Ensuring pods run with the minimum necessary privileges.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Enforcing strict access controls on Kubernetes resources.
- **Audit Logs**: Setting up audit logging to track API server requests.
- **Image Security**: Using signed and verified container images.

For more details, refer to the [hardening guide](docs/hardening-guide.md).
